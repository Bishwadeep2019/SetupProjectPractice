# .NET 9 SETUP PROJECT

Welcome to the **.NET 9 Setup Project**! This repository is designed to help you understand and revise the basics of setting up a .NET 9 project.

---

## **PROJECT FEATURES**

### 1. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**
We are utilizing **Entity Framework Core (ORM)** with the **Code-First Approach** for database management. Below are the key commands:

- **Adding Migrations**:
  ```bash
  add-migration "Migration_Message"
  ```
  Use this command to create migrations for any CRUD operations in the database.

- **Running Migrations**:
  ```bash
  update-database
  ```
  This command runs all pending migrations to update the database.

### 2. **Package Restoration**
Before running the project, **restoring all the NuGet packages** is mandatory. Use the following command:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. **Authentication**
Authentication is not implemented yet but will be added in the future.

### 4. **Manual Mapping**
We are using **manual mapping** for mapping objects and DTOs in this project. Automappers will **not** be used.

### 5. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
The project implements **Simple Injector** for Dependency Injection. Refer to the official [Simple Injector documentation](https://simpleinjector.org/) for more details.
